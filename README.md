This repository contains various examples of data analysis and statistical analyses done throughout the [Google Advanced Data Analytics](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics). The notebooks listed below cover different data analysis topics.

## [Activity_Address missing data.ipynb](https://github.com/emirhansilsupur/google_advanced_data_analytics_program/blob/a71de40329c6eb1d25c7bf74f9a3660820f32f11/Activity_Address%20missing%20data.ipynb)

This notebook focuses on the analysis of missing data. It explains how to identify missing data in a dataset and how to handle these missing values.

## [Activity_Evaluate simple linear regression.ipynb](https://github.com/emirhansilsupur/google_advanced_data_analytics_program/blob/a71de40329c6eb1d25c7bf74f9a3660820f32f11/Activity_Evaluate%20simple%20linear%20regression.ipynb)

This notebook provides information on simple linear regression analysis. You can learn how to build and evaluate a simple regression model on a dataset.

## [Activity_Explore hypothesis testing.ipynb](https://github.com/emirhansilsupur/google_advanced_data_analytics_program/blob/a71de40329c6eb1d25c7bf74f9a3660820f32f11/Activity_Explore%20hypothesis%20testing.ipynb)

This notebook delves into hypothesis testing, specifically A/B testing. It explains how to statistically test for significant differences between two different groups.

## [Activity_ANOVA-Post Hoc Hypothesis testing with Python.ipynb](https://github.com/emirhansilsupur/google_advanced_data_analytics_program/blob/a71de40329c6eb1d25c7bf74f9a3660820f32f11/Activity_ANOVA-Post%20Hoc%20Hypothesis%20testing%20with%20Python.ipynb)

This notebook covers Anova analysis and post-hoc hypothesis testing. It provides insights into comparing variances between different groups and analyzing differences between groups.

## [Activity_Build a K-means model.ipynb](https://github.com/emirhansilsupur/google_advanced_data_analytics_program/blob/a71de40329c6eb1d25c7bf74f9a3660820f32f11/Activity_Build%20a%20K-means%20model.ipynb)

This notebook demonstrates how to build a K-means clustering model for data segmentation and pattern recognition.

## [Activity_Build an XGBoost model.ipynb](https://github.com/emirhansilsupur/google_advanced_data_analytics_program/blob/a71de40329c6eb1d25c7bf74f9a3660820f32f11/Activity_Build%20an%20XGBoost%20model.ipynb)
